    Nick Henderson’s world exists in the cracks between minor chords on felt
    piano and lo-fi tape ambience. On a planet where electro-post-rock-jazz
    exists; Nick’s love of alternate guitar tunings, introspective synth moods
    and all things low-end have an ever evolving place in today’s musical
    landscape.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Passionate about ambient electronic music and old jazz records - and
    obsessed with polyrhythmic death metal and indie-pop songwriting; Nick has a
    treasure chest of both experience and inspiration. A highly sought after
    bassist (upright and electric) with a jazz degree from the Sydney
    Conservatorium of Music, his music creation extends to guitar, singing,
    synthesizers and recording - with a special penchant for old digital drum
    machines and even older upright pianos. Have you ever wondered if you can
    hear dust? Nick has.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Like many multi-instrumentalists in a post/post-music world, Nick suffers
    from multiple-project syndrome. His latest projects include the electronic
    ’50 cycles’, as well as being one half of the singer-songwriter duo ‘Little
    Clouds’. He also composes and collaborates with prog-jazzers 'Arcing Wires’
    and ‘Twirly Bender. Sideman duties include Ellen Kirkwood’s Underwards,
    Emily-Rose and the Wild Things and the Yutaro Okuda Quintet.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    His music has seen him tour the USA, Japan, Indonesia, Netherlands, Germany
    and France, as well as playing alongside Grammy nominated pianist Elio
    VillaFranca and award winning jazz pianist Mike Nock.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    Nick hopes one day that you will enjoy his music the way he enjoys listening
    to his favourite artists; through his Dad’s genuine 70’s vintage B & W
    speakers.
